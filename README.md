# PY-CL-WhileLoop

## Overview
This project focuses on counting the total number of digits in a given number using a while loop in Python. The project consists of an implementation file for the counting function, a script to interactively demonstrate the function, and unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It prompts the user to input a number and then calls the count_digits function from `lab.py` to count the total number of digits in that number. The result is then displayed to the user.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the count_digits function. This function takes a number as input and returns the total number of digits in that number using a while loop.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the count_digits function. It ensures that the function behaves as expected by testing it with various input cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and large numbers.

## Getting Started

- Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
- Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the count_digits function.
- Modify the `lab.py` file to handle negative numbers gracefully if needed.
- Run the test cases in `lab_test.py` to verify the correctness of the count_digits function.
- Explore additional test cases or edge cases to ensure robustness.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop in Python. By completing the implementation and running the provided test cases, you can gain a better understanding of while loops and number manipulation in Python.

Happy Coding!
