    Counts the total number of digits in a given number using a while loop.

    To count the digits in a number, we repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it becomes 0,
    incrementing a counter variable each time. This process continues until there are no more digits
    left in the number.

    :param num: The number for which to count the digits.
    :return: The total number of digits in the given number.
